                <h2>Hello, I'm Mary.</h2>
                <p>I'm a full-stack web developer based in San Francisco. I love bringing ideas to life and solving problems with creativity.</p>
                
                {/* <p>My focus is on coding elegant and intuitive user experiences. </p> */}

<p>My goal is to help the user find what theyâ€™re looking for in a pleasant and engaging way. With a background in digital advertising, I've worked on everything from large-scale websites with a corporate team to independently designing and developing websites from the ground up. While my skillset encompasses the full stack of development, my expertise is in front-end coding and bridging the gap between design and data processing.  </p>
<p>Being in the industry for over a decade means I have to constantly learn new technologies and adapt as I go, often identifying what's a fad and what will stick around. Above all, I stand by the foundations of writing clean, organized code and paying close attention to accessibility.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I can be found <a href="https://stringsmagazine.com/a-bow-of-humility-setting-aside-my-pride-helped-embrace-my-childlike-enthusiasm-for-music/" target='_blank'>playing the violin</a> with my chamber ensemble, jogging around the Presidio, working on a weekly craft project with my fellow female tech buddies, building something with my daughter, or exploring a new neighborhood with my husband.</p>
