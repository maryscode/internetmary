                <p>I'm a full-stack web developer with a focus on coding elegant and intuitive user experiences. </p>

<p>My goal is to help the user find what theyâ€™re looking for in a pleasant and engaging way. With a background in digital advertising, I've worked on everything from large-scale websites with a corporate team to independently designing and developing websites from the ground up. While my skillset encompasses the full stack of development, my expertise is in front-end coding and bridging the gap between design and data processing.  Being in the industry for over a decade means I have to constantly learn new technologies and adapt as I go. Above all, I stand by the foundations of writing clean, organized code and paying close attention to accessibility.</p>
