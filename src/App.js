                <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
                <p>Coding started off as a hobby back when websites were made with tables. I saw building websites as a means to an end. As a kid, I built a website to exhibit my cartoon drawings. As a teenager, I customized blogs to showcase my creative writing. With the help of online tutorials (and strict parents who kept me home with nothing else to do), I honed my coding skills and kept going.</p>
                  
                <p>I blogged and built out my website religiously, gaining a fan base at an early age. But I didn't quite understand if it was the writing I loved, or if the actual fun came from buliding the platform that allowed me to write. At the time, with so few female developers, identifying as a programmer or majoring in computer science felt unrealistic and out of reach. I assumed it was the writing I loved and pursued an English major. However, in every part-time job I took and organization I joined, I would somehow end up behind a computer, working on their website. It eventually became clear that my true creative passion was in the coding itself.</p>
                
                <p>I landed my first job as a programmer in 2008 at a digital consultancy in Palo Alto.
                   Since then, I've tackled a diverse array of projects and explored different team and company sizes. However, no matter the environment, once I start coding, my goals are always the same: make sure it looks good, works on every major browser, and write code in such a way so that my future self won't hate me (i.e. organized, self-evident, and scalable).
                </p>

                <p>Today, I am seeking to work with forward-thinking designers and meticulous engineers to build a world class product that will positively impact culture. I care about the work I do and the people I work with&mdash;I want to refine both the user experience and the development workflow.</p>
                  
                  <p>I am excited for the future of technology and optimistic about the fresh ideas of the generations to come.</p>
